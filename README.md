Repository for pygdbdis gdb no source debugging extensions


The extensions are intended for those of us who use gdb to debug applications without the source 

e.g. for reverse engineering, exploit development, etc.  

They contain a number of helper functions that allow you to easily view the program state in a familiar and easy to use fashion, with string reading, hexdump memory reading, stack viewing, register printout with pointer dereferencing, etc.
